# cloudflare-test-ztclient

Cloudlfare take home test to write a simple multiplatform zero trust client

The list of requirements is listed in ZT Client GUI - Take home test instructions.pdf

Notes:
- No paid software or any additional 3rd party ones were used
- To compile, just open ztclient.xcodeproj and run the app
- Please note that I had to use cargo run in order to run the server as the compiled daemon-lite cannot run on my intel Mac (2018)


Wanted improvements if given more time:
- I would add more unit tests such as the one to cover SocketConnectionApi
- I would implement the bonus tasks especially the one to package it as .pkg
